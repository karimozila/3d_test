'''
make rig which is connected to group node
and unplug and replug capable
set key commands
time commands
randomizer commands ( think about factors and attributes)
save light rigs connected in null node to can close maya file and redit it
save preset with keyed animation of attributes
menu export . import presets
open lights groups slider menu connect update
create button .. when select light nodes
open new window with names of selection and place to name it and button for update selection

think about how user dealing with keyed frames to edit .. for visualize to rekey it
anim : noise .. spin .. overlap to achieve circular movment .. 

key all button which set keyframe for all of this attr in hook grp

edit mode to unplug rig and reedit light situation then realighn rig start point to new situation with the same animation attributes

spin = rotate in z but in one way
loop rotate from 0 to 180
speed multiplayer with time and all anim effects
overlap x value with y value to create circular motion assuming the same speed

when import preset retime the start and end on all animation to the new scene timeslider range with acceptance of user
absloute or relative

geting keyframe with attributes

create double node one for real connections and another for ui and replacment from import 

DISABLE AUTO KEY AND GET VALUE WHEN REALES THE PLAYBACK

thinnk of key frame the last frame in the range before export 

when create 
create hook grp with name of light grp
for each light in slection_ls:
    run rig
